"Dress to Impress" is all about fashion flair. Players use Roblox Studio to pick outfits and vote on the best ones. Game mechanics involve navigating a virtual wardrobe, selecting outfits, and interacting with voting interfaces. Players move their avatars around to different fashion stations and use menu selections to choose and preview outfits. The challenging part is ensuring smooth multiplayer interaction and real-time updates across various devices, which can be difficult given the unpredictable number of players in each session. 

"Hollywood Story: Fashion Star" lets players immerse themselves in a Hollywood career by designing outfits and participating in fashion challenges. While "Episode" offers a series of interactive stories where your choices determine the narrative outcome. Game mechanics of both games consist of tapping on-screen options to make decisions that branch the story in different directions. Each choice can lead to new scenarios and endings, creating a unique path through the narrative. The challenge is in developing a wide range of branching narratives that react to each player's choices. This involves thorough planning and writing to ensure all story paths are coherent and engaging. 

"Cowgirl Crusader" combines action-packed gameplay with puzzles in a Wild West setting. Game mechanics involve using directional buttons to move the character, a jump button for leaping over obstacles, a shoot button for combat, and interacting with objects in the environment to solve puzzles. The key challenge is designing appropriate puzzles that integrate well with the action sequences without disrupting the flow of the game. 

"Squid Game" translates the intense competitions from the TV show into a multiplayer online game. Game mechanics include character movement controlled by directional keys, activities that require quick reflex actions like stopping and starting based on visual or audio cues, and player interactions through cooperative or competitive tasks. Similarly to Dress to Impress, the challenge here would be to ensure stable multiplayer interactions and design puzzles/games that integrate well with the 2D nature of the game. 

"Street Fighter" is a classic 2D fighting game featuring a roster of characters with unique abilities. Game mechanics involve using a combination of directional inputs and button presses to execute moves. Players use up, down, left, and right controls to move their character, while different buttons correspond to various attacks like punches and kicks, including specific moves like lunging and jumping attacks.  The challenge arises when only one player is available. In this case, the game must provide a computer-controlled opponent that can simulate human-like behaviours and strategies. 

"The Sims" is a life simulation game where players create and control virtual characters, managing their daily lives, relationships, careers, and environments. Game mechanics centre on building and decorating homes, fulfilling Sims' needs through a system inspired by Maslow's hierarchy (like hunger, hygiene, socialization), and guiding their life goals and aspirations. Players interact via a point-and-click interface to perform actions or direct Sims' behaviours. The game's sandbox nature allows players to craft unique stories and scenarios, from family life to chaotic drama. Its challenge lies in balancing simulation depth with accessibility, ensuring AI behaviour feels organic while providing players creative freedom. Expansions like "Pets" and "Seasons" also add variety to game. 

"BitLife" is a text-based life simulation game that emphasizes decision-making and player agency. Game mechanics revolve around making choices through a branching narrative system. Players navigate life events such as education, relationships, careers, and health by selecting options from a list, with the outcomes affecting the character’s progression. The interface is primarily menu-driven, optimized for mobile platforms, and includes simple touch controls for interaction. Random events and mini goals add layers of unpredictability and replay ability. Like "The Sims," the challenge lies in maintaining player engagement through diverse narrative paths and ensuring the balance between realism and humour.  

"Papers, Please" is a simulation game where players assume the role of a border checkpoint inspector in the fictional nation of Arstotzka. The gameplay revolves around reviewing immigration documents to determine whether travellers should be allowed entry, deported, or detained. Game mechanics include cross-checking information like passport details, visas, and entry permits against evolving rules and regulations, requiring players to stay vigilant for discrepancies, forgeries, or red flags. The game’s challenge is in balancing efficiency and accuracy under time constraints, while moral dilemmas—such as choosing between helping a desperate traveller or following state orders—can also add emotional weight. 

"Fruit Ninja" is an action arcade game that revolves around fast-paced slicing mechanics using touch controls. Players swipe their fingers across the screen to cut through flying fruits while avoiding bombs that can end the game or reduce their score. The core gameplay is designed for quick, engaging sessions, with mechanics that emphasize reflexes, precision, and combo chaining for higher scores. Various game modes, such as Classic, Arcade, and Zen, introduce different challenges, from survival-based endurance to high-score chases within a time limit. In Classic Mode, players must slice as many fruits as possible as they pop up on the screen. They start with three lives and lose one each time they miss a single fruit. The game ends if all three lives are lost. Additionally, bombs occasionally appear, and slicing one results in instant defeat, adding an element of risk and requiring careful precision. 

"Overcooked" is a cooperative cooking simulation game that emphasizes teamwork, time management, and coordination. Players control chefs in chaotic kitchens, working together to prepare and serve meals under strict time limits. The gameplay revolves around completing orders by chopping ingredients, cooking dishes, assembling plates, and delivering meals to customers—all while navigating dynamic kitchen layouts that introduce obstacles, hazards, and shifting environments. In this game, you team up with friends to serve as many customers in a restaurant as possible. Each level presents different recipes, kitchen setups, and cooking instructions, requiring players to quickly adapt to new challenges. A minimum number of points must be achieved to progress to the next level, pushing players to work efficiently and communicate effectively.
