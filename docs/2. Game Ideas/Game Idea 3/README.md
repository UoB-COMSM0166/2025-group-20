<h2>Smoothie Operator</h2>

<p>This game merges the reaction-based fun of Fruit Ninja with the recipe-based coordination of Overcooked. The core mechanic revolves around slicing fruits that are tossed from the bottom of the screen before they fall out of range. However, unlike Fruit Ninja, players must slice fruits according to specific smoothie recipes displayed at the top of the screen. Additionally, each fruit requires a specific slicing motion (e.g., horizontal, vertical, diagonal). The challenge comes from remembering the correct slicing order and motion, ensuring accuracy and speed. Players lose a life if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the wrong slicing motion for a fruit.</li>
  <li>Slice the wrong fruit that does not belong to the current recipe.</li>
  <li>Miss a fruit that should have been sliced.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Twist</h2>

<p>Our game introduces two key twists that set it apart from Fruit Ninja. First, a recipe-based slicing, where players must follow a smoothie recipe displayed on the screen, slicing fruits in the correct order and with the correct motion (e.g., horizontal, vertical, diagonal). This adds a memory and strategy element instead of just slicing everything on sight. Second, the game will have no immediate feedback on progress. Unlike traditional games that explicitly tell players what they’ve completed, our game does not track or highlight previously sliced fruits. Players must remember what they have already sliced and what remains in the recipe. This forces them to stay focused and engaged throughout the game.</p>

<h2>Game Mechanics</h2>

<p>Players use their mouse to slice fruits before they drop out of the screen. The game will be endless, continuously generating random smoothie recipes with varying numbers of required fruits (e.g., 4–8 fruits per recipe). Each correctly sliced fruit earns the player points, which are displayed at the top of the screen. The game will notify players when they slice the wrong fruit, use the incorrect slicing motion, and miss a required fruit.</p>

<p>Players cannot drop more than three necessary fruits, or the game will end. Occasionally, bombs will appear on the screen—if sliced, they result in an instant game over. The game’s challenge increases over time as recipes become more difficult, requiring better memory, accuracy, and reaction time.</p>

<h2>Art and Graphics</h2>

<p>While the game will have simple visuals and feature a plain, non-moving background as a wall and fruit graphics with both whole and sliced versions. In addition, it will feature clear user interface elements, such as a recipe tracker at the top of the screen, total score achieved in-game, and a lives indicator.</p>
