Dress To Impress to Fight 
This game is inspired by fashion games (including ‘Hollywood a Fashion Star’ and ‘Dress to Impress’) and combat games (including ‘Street Fighter’ and ‘Cowgirl Crusader’). The first aspect of the game will involve customizing your own character and dressing her up. You start with a limited choice of clothes and accessories, unlocking more as you earn more points. Points are earned through engaging in armed combats with zombie men. 

Character Creation 

Before the game begins, players can create their own character, customizing their appearance with a selection of basic outfits and accessories. As you rack up points by combating zombies, you'll earn currency like gems or cash based on your performance. These rewards allow you to unlock more outfits and accessories. Different outfits can grant buffs such as increased damage resistance, faster movement, or bonus currency from kills.  

Weaponry 

The journey begins with simple weapons, like a simple pistol, but as you level up, you can acquire and upgrade more weapons. Each weapon can come with distinct advantages. Weapon upgrades enhance stats like firepower, reload speed, or magazine capacity, allowing players to adapt to the increasing intensity of the zombie waves. 

Game Mechanics 

The screen design features a side-scrolling layout where your character moves from the left side of the screen to the right, while zombies approach from the right. A score counter in the top corner tracks your zombie kills, and the number of points collected on the left. The game's movement system includes keyboard commands, letting you manoeuvre forward, backward, jump, and duck to evade zombie attacks. Zombies can appear unpredictably from behind buildings, out of manholes, or even by crashing through windows, ensuring players stay on their toes. Each level introduces new environments—city streets, farms, forests—each with unique zombie types and challenges. For instance, city levels might feature faster zombies, while forests could have camouflaged ones that ambush unsuspecting players. Enemy Variety: Include different zombie types, such as: 

Runners: Fast, aggressive zombies that overwhelm players. 
Tanks: Huge zombies with high health and devastating attacks. 
Spitters: Zombies that launch acid or projectiles, creating environmental hazards. 
Stealth Zombies: Lurking enemies that attack when least expected. 
Bosses: Epic battles with special zombies that require unique strategies to defeat. 
 

The Twist 

The game takes the core mechanics of Street Fighter and Cowgirl Crusader and adds a twist: customizable, fashionable outfits that players can mix and match to create unique looks. Players engage in fast-paced 1v1 battles using signature moves, combos, and special attacks. The twist lies in the ability to unlock and equip stylish clothing, from streetwear to fantasy armour, with some pieces offering bonuses like increased speed or enhanced damage.  The challenge lies in balancing the fashion and combat systems, ensuring skill drives victory while players fight in style.
